    <h1>About the EDA way...</h1>

  <p>I can see immediately this is a course that you get out what you put in. It is similar to the way I try to teach in my classes.
    Instead of telling my students; this is the set of skills you will learn, I ask them, what do they want to make - now go
    and find the resources and learn the skills you need to get to that end goal.  I can see some pros and cons for myself personally.
    I love getting through a list, and ticking off tasks and feeling the accomplishment of <i>finishing</i>. I really need to stop that
      in some ways. I will need to be more focussed on the learning journey and make sure I understand the concepts thoroughly.
      My own preference though, is to skip to the task and learn as I am doing it. I definitely don't like reading something or watching a
      long video and taking notes; but have tried to start doing this to form good habits.</p>


  <p>  First impressions are that there are lots of keen people on the course and that it will be really collaborative, which is great.
    Nice to feel a part of something.  Another impression is that the tools are a bit intimidating, but as we conquer them they should
    make life a lot easier. Its just taking time to do the conquering.  Its also super easy to get in touch with someone and to get
    timely advice and help, which I am definitely not used to in my work environment! So its a nice change.</p>


    <p>I feel like I have high expectations of myself to really engage with the content and do the best I can, and I am a huge fan of
    collaborative and supportive learning environments.  It definitely feels like a place I can learn at my own pace but be challenged too.</p>


  <p>No, I had a pretty good idea from my friend who had done EDA earlier this year, about what was in store.  I was pretty prepared for the workload
  but its a new feeling of not understanding things, or not <i>getting</i> concepts straight away. Nice to be challenged though.</p>


  <p>At the moment I have nothing but good excited vibes, may it long last.  Ka mau te wehi!</p>
