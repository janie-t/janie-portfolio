    	  <h2>HTML, CSS, the DOM - Part 1</h2>
    	  <img src="../images/pink_flower.jpg" />
    	  <p>My kids were colouring in a blank poster today, with just the outlines of some animal pictures.  HTML is like that basic outline. It provides the content of text, images, video etc, but nothing else.  CSS is like the animals being coloured in different hues, and also given spots or stripes. CSS provides the styling such as colour and font.  The DOM is the structure of the poster. It is a way of interacting with the HTML and CSS and provides a familiar structure that helps us to find familiarity in every website. The DOM is also a way of interacting with, and editing the website, without using a text editor. There are developer tools provided in the browser and you can inspect specific elements to see their properties.</p>

    	  <h2>HTML, CSS, the DOM - Part 2</h2>
    	  <img src="../images/kids.jpg" />
        <p>Grid based design is where the html layout is structured using rows and columns.  The common number of columns is 12 to allow for a range of layout designs. This is a flexible way of allowing different layouts while staying with the boxify concept.</p>
        <p>Responsive web design is a big deal these days because there are so many different kinds of devices being used.  From large screen desktops, to small mobile phones - the same website needs to be able to be usable and readable on every device in the world! So being responsive is kinda important!</p>
        <p>Semantic structure is when we start looking at the hierarchy of elements such as text on a page. Good practice is giving larger headings at the top of a page, an h1 tag, and this tells the browser that the heading is important and will be semantically placed at the top.  Then h2 under that, and h3 under that, etc.</p>
        <p>I hope that when I go back to my site now, and apply the grid design, it will make it a lot easier to adjust things like centering the navs.  Also, I would like to say that placepuppy.it just made my day! EDIT: sniff sniff, it no longer exists... :(</p>

    	  <h2>Responsive, mobile-first sites</h2>
    	  <img src="../images/georgia.jpg" />
        <p>A responsive website is one that will automatically adjust itself to fit your device. It will resize text, headings, images and other elements, change the layout and any other changes that help the person (you) read the website.  It's important because of the huge range of devices used these days. Most people would use a mobile device ie. a phone, to browse websites and so any business or organisation wants to make sure the user has a good experience with their site.</p>
        <p>Mobile first design is where the layout is determined based on the dimensions of a mobile phone initially, and then changed to fit desktop browsers later on.  If you do desktop design first, its more likely to be a website that needs a bit of computer processing power and if opened on a phone, may be clunky and slow, or not work at all.  If the design is mobile-first, then its likely to work well on phones, and also desktops.</p>
        <p>Frameworks are like libraries. They have a bundle of code that you can borrow (forever), so that web developers don't need to keep reinventing the wheel.  Some pros are that it saves time and you can design a website that is industry standard and works well for most users and browsers. The cons are that they can be complicated, and take up more processing power to utilise than a simple website. You also have to stick to the framework semantics which you may not be used to.</p>
        <p>A wireframe is a sketch or outline of what the proposed website design will look like. It is usually just boxes or frames for where the content will go - no writing or pictures or colours yet.  It is used to get an idea of the balance on the screen mainly, and to see if elements fit on the page nicely.</p>

        <p>I found it difficult to get the header navs to go underneath the teacup logo when the screen size was smaller. It took a while to see the true width of those elements. It was also hard to get the elements to properly center on the page and I haven't figured that one out yet. I also need to work out how to get the nav links to turn into 3 lines under the logo when in mobile mode.</p>

        <h2>Javascript basics</h2>
        <img src="../images/alice.jpg" />
        <p>How does Javascript compare to HTML and CSS? Learning JS made me use parts of my brain I did not know existed. Lol. But no actually Javascript is fantastic. It is. If the webpage was a house, HTML is the brick and mortar. CSS is the paint and the style of curtains. And Javascript, is the automatic door opener, the dimmable lights and the temperature controlled wine cellar.  It makes it all so much more interactive and...cool.</p>
        <p>Control flow and loops is the way in which JS sets out instructions or steps.  It is in order. For example, making a cup of tea. You could first turn on the jug. Then you have to keep checking if the jug is boiled (loop) until the right condition is met, which is hot water. At which point, and not before, you could then pour water into your mug.</p>
        <p>Data in arrays is accessed by calling the data's place in the list, ie. [0], [1], [2] etc. A piece of data in objects however, needs to be found with its unique name ie. {"Bob"}.</p>
        <p>Functions are a bunch of instructions put together in a tidy wee box and given a name. We can then use the function name later on, and avoid having to type out the same instructions over and over. Its a time saver.</p>

        <h2>Problem solving</h2>
        <img src="../images/bridge.jpg" />
        <p>Oh, hey non-tech friend! So yeah, this one time I was trying to, like, get this programme to do this task. It was a simple task, all I really had to do was replicate the instructions from another programme. Easy. I typed it all out and pressed 'go'. Nothing. I spent a good 30 minutes comparing the code, line by line. Pressed go. Still nothing. I was getting some little messages popping up, but who knows what they meant, goddam thing should have been working. It was EXACTLY the same as the first code. I finally bit the bullet and read the instructions. It says getElementsByClassName. I had typed out getElementByClassName. Perhaps you can understand my frustration. Javascript reminds me a lot of golf...</p>
        <p>Now I'm supposed to tell you how I solved a problem in an elegant way....bahhhh ha ha haaaaaa...cough cough. If elegant means not swearing at the computer, then possibly I did that, once or twice. Googling, I feel, is not elegant. Because it sadly doesn't give you the exact correct answer you need. Actually, the best time I solved a problem was when I talked to the dog about it. I was trying to get a programme to do a fairly simple maths equation. I used to be good at maths, once, a long long long time ago. I couldn't figure out the order of the instructions and what things (variables) I was supposed to use.  So, I told the dog what I was trying to do. She barked, and the answer sort of formulated in my head. I learned that I should try a different approach quicker rather than bang my head against a brick wall. Or swear a lot. It was a roller coaster of emotion - intense concentration, then frustration, some despair, anger, then finally elation. It actually felt pretty good to solve the mystery without Google. Google is like a drug. Drugs are bad. Don't do drugs.</p>
        <p><b><i>Pseudocode</i></b> is really handy but very hard to spell. It made the activities much easier to complete, in fact without the guidance of pseudocode I doubt I would have been able to finish a lot of them. Great tool, definitely happy to use this.
        </p>
        <p><b><i>Trying Something</i></b> is what I do all day. I just jump in start typing. I've found it not terribly succesful though and probably wastes a lot of my time. Will not be doing as much of it.</p>
        <p><b><i>Rubber Ducky</i></b> - as my dog knows, I am a fan. Its just so good to clarify your mind. Looking at a bunch of code on the screen and trying to see issues is hard. Much better to look away and talk it out. Or go to Slack and type it out with your friends. Who are more communicative and helpful than the dog.</p>
        <p><b><i>Reading error messages</i></b> is something I don't love doing, but am getting better at. A few weeks ago I was going cross-eyed trying to decipher Git error messages. Now they are not so scary, but still not my friend.</p>
        <p><b><i>Console.logging</i></b> is not at the top of my debugging list, but I know its there in case of emergency.</p>
        <p><b><i>Googling</i></b> is an easy thing to do, but not necessarily the best method. I have a bit of a habit, I know, but I am trying to not use it as such as crutch.</p>
        <p><b><i>Asking peers for help</i></b> alllll day, I love asking for help. I have such clever people in my cohort that I would be silly not to.</p>
        <p><b><i>Asking coaches for help</i></b> - they are pretty helpful. In a non-direct and guiding way. I feel like since the panic has subsided since the start of the course I don't leap to asking the tutors for help as much.</p>
        <p><b><i>Improving your process with reflection</i></b> is a work in progress. I haven't had the energy to reflect too much. Too busy body scanning myself to try and get to sleep and get the javascript out of my head.</p>
        <p><b><i>.map()</i></b> is a javascript method which is applied to an array or list. map() uses the nominated function and applies that function to each element in the array, in order. It then collects the results of the function being applied on each element, in a new array.  An example of this may be a function that multiplies each number in an array by itself. If the initial array was [1,3,6] then the map() uses the multiplication function to create a new array [1, 9,36].  The original array is still there; [1,3,6].
        </p>
        <p><b><i>.filter()</i></b> is a method that also creates a new array after applying a function to an existing array. In the new array it only includes elements from the first array that return 'true' to the function. For example an array of names ['Bob', 'Sarah', 'John', 'Sue'] has a function applied to it that finds people born before a certain date. The .filter() will create a second array like ['Bob', 'Sue'] because they were born before the specified date in the function. Once again, the first array stays unchanged.</p>
        <p><b><i>.reduce()</i></b> is a method that will apply a function to an array and return a summarised version of the array. There are four parameters, previousValue, currentValue, currentIndex and array. Depending on what those parameters are, will determine how the initial array is summarised. Numbers can be added together. Strings can be collated into one sentence. For example an array with substrings such as [[1,2],[3,4],[5,6]], using .reduce() with appropriate parameters, can return [1,2,3,4,5,6].  Alternatively an array of [1,2,3,4,5] can be reduced using a Sum function and return [15]. A variable with several elements of say; word: "This", nextword: "has", thirdWord: "been", lastWord: "reduced" could return a reduced array of ['This', 'has', 'been', 'reduced'] </p>

        <p><b>Parentheses ( )</b></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Hold the parameters passed to a function (function calls) e.g. function(2,7)</li>
          <li>Group an expression to control the order of operations such as multiplication and addition e.g. (6*4)+(3/5)</li>
          <li>To indicate an empty/anonymous function ie. function()</li>
          <li>To surround conditional statements e.g. if (condition1)
        </ul>
        <p><b>Brackets [ ]</b></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Accessing the properties of an object e.g. console.log(myArray[0])</li>
          <li>Holding elements of an array e.g. var myArray = [0,1,2,3,4]</li>
          <li>Brackets always indicate the contents are an Array.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><b>Braces { }</b></p>
        <ul>
          <li>A sequence of statements inside {} is called a block e.g. var myVar = { property: value, property: value}</li>
          <li>Shows where a function starts and ends e.g. function add () {  the function code here }</li>
          <li>To show where a loop or conditional statement starts and ends e.g. if (condition 1) { result code here }</li>
        </ul>
        <p><b>Single quotes ' '</b></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Used to contain a string, or inside a string, sometimes in combination with double quotes e.g. 'This is a string' or "This is called a 'string'"</li>
          <li>Important to be consistent - if using single quotes, always use single quotes</li>
        </ul>
        <p><b>Double quotes " "</b></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Used for strings also, but can avoid some issues that arise for single quotes such as needing a quote within a quote ie. 'This is called a 'String'', as you can't put single quotes inside single quotes.</li>
          <li>Use "This is a 'String'" instead</li>
          <li>Comes down to preference, but whichever you prefer, stick with it and be consistent.</li>
