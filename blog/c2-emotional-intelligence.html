    <h3>EMOTIONAL INTELLIGENCE</h3>

    <div id="main">
      <p>One of the main things I took from the Search Within Yourself book is how we can change our mindset, the way we react to things and learn better. So often we think that our 'ways of doing' are set in stone and cannot be changed but this course shows that it is possible. Not only that, it is easy to do with some commitment. I enjoyed the humour in the writing and found it inspiring and very achievable.
