<p><b>TIME AND HABITS</b></p>


<p>I tried the hour timebox while going over the resources.  The habit technique I tried was making a small change each morning.
I set the alarm 30 mins earlier and take the dog for a short walk. I am doing this every morning with the goal of eventually a) getting up earlier and earlier each day b) walk an hour each day. Am using the technique of making small changes, which are easy to repeat, with the long term affect that it turns into a habit which
then changes other areas of my life.  I also tried meditating which is something I have been interested in and wanting
to try, so I am going to aim to do that every morning for two minutes (to start with) and increase over time.</p>

<p>I find it interesting to read about growth mindset outside of the educational setting. It is quite a popular thing at the
moment in some schools, to help students develop a growth mindset and it is something I am quite familar with, in the context of
secondary education. It really is something that can be useful in every day life and I think a great habit to develop for ourselves</p>

<p>Pomodoro technique works well for me, because if I try and read or focus on a resource for too long I start to lose
concentration but won't stop - with the result that I skip over the task or resource and don't learn as deeply as I should.
Working for a set amount of time really helped to keep the focus consistent. I also didn't get tired
as much, as was having regular breaks.</p>

<p>I am going to try longer meditation and also research more into the Fogg Method - how to give myself triggers to do the
behaviours I want to see - was an interesting comment from one of the resources that no behaviour happens without a trigger.</p>
