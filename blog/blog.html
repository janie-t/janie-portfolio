    	<h2>About the EDA way...</h2>
    	<img src="http://lorempixum.com/400/100/nature/1" />
      <p>I can see immediately this is a course that you get out what you put in. It is similar to the way I try to teach in my classes. Instead of telling my students; this is the set of skills you will learn, I ask them, what do they want to make - now go and find the resources and learn the skills you need to get to that end goal.  I can see some pros and cons for myself personally. I love getting through a list, and ticking off tasks and feeling the accomplishment of <i>finishing</i>. I really need to stop that in some ways. I will need to be more focussed on the learning journey and make sure I understand the concepts thoroughly. My own preference though, is to skip to the task and learn as I am doing it. I definitely don't like reading something or watching a long video and taking notes; but have tried to start doing this to form good habits.</p>


      <p>  First impressions are that there are lots of keen people on the course and that it will be really collaborative, which is great. Nice to feel a part of something.  Another impression is that the tools are a bit intimidating, but as we conquer them they should make life a lot easier. Its just taking time to do the conquering.  Its also super easy to get in touch with someone and to get timely advice and help, which I am definitely not used to in my work environment! So its a nice change.</p>

      <p>I feel like I have high expectations of myself to really engage with the content and do the best I can, and I am a huge fan of collaborative and supportive learning environments.  It definitely feels like a place I can learn at my own pace but be challenged too.</p>

      <p>I had a pretty good idea from my friend who had done EDA earlier this year, about what was in store.  I was pretty prepared for the workload but its a new feeling of not understanding things, or not <i>getting</i> concepts straight away.</p>

      <p>At the moment I have nothing but good excited vibes, may it long last.  Ka mau te wehi!</p>

    	<h2>Developing better time management and habits</h2>
    	<img src="http://lorempixum.com/400/100/nature/2" />
      <p>I tried the hour timebox while going over the resources.  The habit technique I tried was making a small change each morning. I set the alarm 30 mins earlier and take the dog for a short walk. I am doing this every morning with the goal of eventually a) getting up earlier and earlier each day b) walk an hour each day. Am using the technique of making small changes, which are easy to repeat, with the long term affect that it turns into a habit which then changes other areas of my life.  I also tried meditating which is something I have been interested in and wanting to try, so I am going to aim to do that every morning for two minutes (to start with) and increase over time.</p>

      <p>I find it interesting to read about growth mindset outside of the educational setting. It is quite a popular thing at the moment in some schools, to help students develop a growth mindset and it is something I am quite familar with, in the context of secondary education. It really is something that can be useful in every day life and I think a great habit to develop for ourselves</p>

      <p>Pomodoro technique works well for me, because if I try and read or focus on a resource for too long I start to lose  concentration but won't stop - with the result that I skip over the task or resource and don't learn as deeply as I should. Working for a set amount of time really helped to keep the focus consistent. I also didn't get tired  as much, as was having regular breaks.</p>

      <p>I am going to try longer meditation and also research more into the Fogg Method - how to give myself triggers to do the behaviours I want to see - was an interesting comment from one of the resources that no behaviour happens without a trigger.</p>

    	<h2>Mindfulness and Meditation</h2>
    	<img src="http://lorempixum.com/400/100/nature/3" />
      <p>One of the main things I took from the Search Within Yourself book is how we can change our mindset, the way we react to things and learn better. So often we think that our 'ways of doing' are set in stone and cannot be changed but this course shows that it is possible. Not only that, it is easy to do with some commitment. I enjoyed the humour in the writing and found it inspiring and very achievable.

    	<h2>HTML, CSS, the DOM - Part 1</h2>
    	<img src="http://lorempixum.com/400/100/nature/3" />
    	<p>My kids were colouring in a blank poster today, with just the outlines of some animal pictures.  HTML is like that basic outline. It provides the content of text, images, video etc, but nothing else.  CSS is like the animals being coloured in different hues, and also given spots or stripes. CSS provides the styling such as colour and font.  The DOM is the structure of the poster. It is a way of interacting with the HTML and CSS and provides a familiar structure that helps us to find familiarity in every website. The DOM is also a way of interacting with, and editing the website, without using a text editor. There are developer tools provided in the browser and you can inspect specific elements to see their properties.</p>

    	<h2>HTML, CSS, the DOM - Part 2</h2>
    	<img src="http://lorempixum.com/400/100/nature/3" />
      <p>Grid based design is where the html layout is structured using rows and columns.  The common number of columns is 12 to allow for a range of layout designs. This is a flexible way of allowing different layouts while staying with the boxify concept.
      </p>

      <p>Responsive web design is a big deal these days because there are so many different kinds of devices being used.  From large screen desktops, to small mobile phones - the same website needs to be able to be usable and readable on every device in the world! So being responsive is kinda important!</p>

      <p>Semantic structure is when we start looking at the hierarchy of elements such as text on a page. Good practice is giving larger headings at the top of a page, an h1 tag, and this tells the browser that the heading is important and will be semantically placed at the top.  Then h2 under that, and h3 under that, etc.</p>

      <p>I hope that when I go back to my site now, and apply the grid design, it will make it a lot easier to adjust things like centering the navs.  Also, I would like to say that placepuppy.it just made my day! EDIT: sniff sniff, it no longer exists... :(</p>
