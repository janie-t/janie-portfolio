    	  <h2>About the EDA way...</h2>
    	  <img src="../images/headerImage2.jpg"/>
        <p>I can see immediately this is a course that you get out what you put in. It is similar to the way I try to teach in my classes. Instead of telling my students; this is the set of skills you will learn, I ask them, what do they want to make - now go and find the resources and learn the skills you need to get to that end goal.  I can see some pros and cons for myself personally. I love getting through a list, and ticking off tasks and feeling the accomplishment of <i>finishing</i>. I really need to stop that in some ways. I will need to be more focussed on the learning journey and make sure I understand the concepts thoroughly. My own preference though, is to skip to the task and learn as I am doing it. I definitely don't like reading something or watching a long video and taking notes; but have tried to start doing this to form good habits.</p>
        <p>  First impressions are that there are lots of keen people on the course and that it will be really collaborative, which is great. Nice to feel a part of something.  Another impression is that the tools are a bit intimidating, but as we conquer them they should make life a lot easier. Its just taking time to do the conquering.  Its also super easy to get in touch with someone and to get timely advice and help, which I am definitely not used to in my work environment! So its a nice change.</p>
        <p>I feel like I have high expectations of myself to really engage with the content and do the best I can, and I am a huge fan of collaborative and supportive learning environments.  It definitely feels like a place I can learn at my own pace but be challenged too.</p>
        <p>I had a pretty good idea from my friend who had done EDA earlier this year, about what was in store.  I was pretty prepared for the workload but its a new feeling of not understanding things, or not <i>getting</i> concepts straight away.</p>
        <p>At the moment I have nothing but good excited vibes, may it long last.  Ka mau te wehi!</p>

    	  <h2>Developing better time management and habits</h2>
    	  <img src="../images/tui.jpg" />
        <p>I tried the hour timebox while going over the resources.  The habit technique I tried was making a small change each morning. I set the alarm 30 mins earlier and take the dog for a short walk. I am doing this every morning with the goal of eventually a) getting up earlier and earlier each day b) walk an hour each day. Am using the technique of making small changes, which are easy to repeat, with the long term affect that it turns into a habit which then changes other areas of my life.  I also tried meditating which is something I have been interested in and wanting to try, so I am going to aim to do that every morning for two minutes (to start with) and increase over time.</p>
        <p>I find it interesting to read about growth mindset outside of the educational setting. It is quite a popular thing at the moment in some schools, to help students develop a growth mindset and it is something I am quite familar with, in the context of secondary education. It really is something that can be useful in every day life and I think a great habit to develop for ourselves</p>
        <p>Pomodoro technique works well for me, because if I try and read or focus on a resource for too long I start to lose  concentration but won't stop - with the result that I skip over the task or resource and don't learn as deeply as I should. Working for a set amount of time really helped to keep the focus consistent. I also didn't get tired  as much, as was having regular breaks.</p>
        <p>I am going to try longer meditation and also research more into the Fogg Method - how to give myself triggers to do the behaviours I want to see - was an interesting comment from one of the resources that no behaviour happens without a trigger.</p>

    	  <h2>Mindfulness and Meditation</h2>
    	  <img src="../images/roxy.jpg" />
        <p>One of the main things I took from the Search Within Yourself book is how we can change our mindset, the way we react to things and learn better. So often we think that our 'ways of doing' are set in stone and cannot be changed but this course shows that it is possible. Not only that, it is easy to do with some commitment. I enjoyed the humour in the writing and found it inspiring and very achievable.</p>

        <h2>Meditation process</h2>
        <img src="../images/aaliya.jpg" />
        <p>The process over product actually confused me more, I feel. I read lots. Too much perhaps. I felt like I found tutorials that were just too informative and too complicated for what I wanted to achieve, but I didn't realise that till I had gotten half way through changing my code. In the end I came across a really simple skeleton based template and I finally understood it enough to adapt it to my needs. So, maybe the whole process did kinda work, and I learnt more about what I didn't want to do than figuring out what I did...hmm weird...Oh and I TOTALLY went too far down a multitude of rabbit holes. Like, so many damn holes...</p>
        <p>Before I read Meng's book I thought a lot about meditation. Often thought I should give it a go. Or more likely should make it a regular thing. I thought that it was a good thing to be able to do. But I have not yet been able to make it a habit and get good at it. Yet. Nothing much new in this chapter but it definitely reminded me that it's all about training the brain and flexing those meditating muscles.</p>

         <h2>Daily Mindfulness</h2>
         <img src="../images/bubble.jpg" />
         <p>I thought I was a pretty good listener, but I realised just how little of my attention is actually on my partner when he is talking. Granted, he talks a lot. So giving him my full attention and a looping conversation was good for me. He also appreciated it as my feeding back on what I thought he had said, helped him feel like I was truly interested in the topic. Even though I wasn't. Useful technique...</p>
         <p>To sustain my mindfulness practice I will need to stick with small things first, and do less than I am capable of. Because I am still at the point where it is not a habit and I don't want to give up completely because something feels too onerous.</p>
         <p>We do looping conversation a lot in schools. When talking to students, or during difficult conversations with colleagues, the looping technique is very common. What improves that is the dipping, especially when you are discussing difficult issues or topics, and your emotions are all over the place.</p>

          <h2>Self Confidence</h2>
          <img src="../images/comic.jpg" />
          <p>The relationship between mindfulness and self awareness is a linear one. The better one becomes at mindfulness, the more aware you will be of your own emotions and the response your body has when feeling something. Then once you master self awareness you carry on along the linear journey towards self confidence.</p>
          <p>I remember years ago as a teenager doing a meditation exercise at school. The first part of it was doing Body Scanning, except we had to try and make each part we focused on, relax.  I did the body scanning again the other night. It was difficult to concentrate long on each part, and I didn't get down to my toes! I think I may have just passed out. So it was great for relaxing.  I felt like I didn't do it well, but also felt like I did better at the focus than in previous attempts.</p>
          <p>My Emotions Are Not Me; what a great reminder to not get too involved with your emotions especially when they are not good ones. I am looking forward to working on this skill more, and being able to control and also avoid emotional upsets. Hopefully some of it will rub off on the 4 year old too...</p>
