    	  <h2>About the EDA way...</h2>
    	  <img src="../images/headerImage2.jpg"/>
        <p>I can see immediately this is a course that you get out what you put in. It is similar to the way I try to teach in my classes. Instead of telling my students; this is the set of skills you will learn, I ask them, what do they want to make - now go and find the resources and learn the skills you need to get to that end goal.  I can see some pros and cons for myself personally. I love getting through a list, and ticking off tasks and feeling the accomplishment of <i>finishing</i>. I really need to stop that in some ways. I will need to be more focussed on the learning journey and make sure I understand the concepts thoroughly. My own preference though, is to skip to the task and learn as I am doing it. I definitely don't like reading something or watching a long video and taking notes; but have tried to start doing this to form good habits.</p>
        <p>  First impressions are that there are lots of keen people on the course and that it will be really collaborative, which is great. Nice to feel a part of something.  Another impression is that the tools are a bit intimidating, but as we conquer them they should make life a lot easier. Its just taking time to do the conquering.  Its also super easy to get in touch with someone and to get timely advice and help, which I am definitely not used to in my work environment! So its a nice change.</p>
        <p>I feel like I have high expectations of myself to really engage with the content and do the best I can, and I am a huge fan of collaborative and supportive learning environments.  It definitely feels like a place I can learn at my own pace but be challenged too.</p>
        <p>I had a pretty good idea from my friend who had done EDA earlier this year, about what was in store.  I was pretty prepared for the workload but its a new feeling of not understanding things, or not <i>getting</i> concepts straight away.</p>
        <p>At the moment I have nothing but good excited vibes, may it long last.  Ka mau te wehi!</p>

    	  <h2>Developing better time management and habits</h2>
    	  <img src="../images/tui.jpg" />
        <p>I tried the hour timebox while going over the resources.  The habit technique I tried was making a small change each morning. I set the alarm 30 mins earlier and take the dog for a short walk. I am doing this every morning with the goal of eventually a) getting up earlier and earlier each day b) walk an hour each day. Am using the technique of making small changes, which are easy to repeat, with the long term affect that it turns into a habit which then changes other areas of my life.  I also tried meditating which is something I have been interested in and wanting to try, so I am going to aim to do that every morning for two minutes (to start with) and increase over time.</p>
        <p>I find it interesting to read about growth mindset outside of the educational setting. It is quite a popular thing at the moment in some schools, to help students develop a growth mindset and it is something I am quite familar with, in the context of secondary education. It really is something that can be useful in every day life and I think a great habit to develop for ourselves</p>
        <p>Pomodoro technique works well for me, because if I try and read or focus on a resource for too long I start to lose  concentration but won't stop - with the result that I skip over the task or resource and don't learn as deeply as I should. Working for a set amount of time really helped to keep the focus consistent. I also didn't get tired  as much, as was having regular breaks.</p>
        <p>I am going to try longer meditation and also research more into the Fogg Method - how to give myself triggers to do the behaviours I want to see - was an interesting comment from one of the resources that no behaviour happens without a trigger.</p>

    	  <h2>Mindfulness and Meditation</h2>
    	  <img src="../images/roxy.jpg" />
        <p>One of the main things I took from the Search Within Yourself book is how we can change our mindset, the way we react to things and learn better. So often we think that our 'ways of doing' are set in stone and cannot be changed but this course shows that it is possible. Not only that, it is easy to do with some commitment. I enjoyed the humour in the writing and found it inspiring and very achievable.</p>

    	  <h2>HTML, CSS, the DOM - Part 1</h2>
    	  <img src="../images/pink_flower.jpg" />
    	  <p>My kids were colouring in a blank poster today, with just the outlines of some animal pictures.  HTML is like that basic outline. It provides the content of text, images, video etc, but nothing else.  CSS is like the animals being coloured in different hues, and also given spots or stripes. CSS provides the styling such as colour and font.  The DOM is the structure of the poster. It is a way of interacting with the HTML and CSS and provides a familiar structure that helps us to find familiarity in every website. The DOM is also a way of interacting with, and editing the website, without using a text editor. There are developer tools provided in the browser and you can inspect specific elements to see their properties.</p>

    	  <h2>HTML, CSS, the DOM - Part 2</h2>
    	  <img src="../images/kids.jpg" />
        <p>Grid based design is where the html layout is structured using rows and columns.  The common number of columns is 12 to allow for a range of layout designs. This is a flexible way of allowing different layouts while staying with the boxify concept.</p>
        <p>Responsive web design is a big deal these days because there are so many different kinds of devices being used.  From large screen desktops, to small mobile phones - the same website needs to be able to be usable and readable on every device in the world! So being responsive is kinda important!</p>
        <p>Semantic structure is when we start looking at the hierarchy of elements such as text on a page. Good practice is giving larger headings at the top of a page, an h1 tag, and this tells the browser that the heading is important and will be semantically placed at the top.  Then h2 under that, and h3 under that, etc.</p>
        <p>I hope that when I go back to my site now, and apply the grid design, it will make it a lot easier to adjust things like centering the navs.  Also, I would like to say that placepuppy.it just made my day! EDIT: sniff sniff, it no longer exists... :(</p>

    	  <h2>Responsive, mobile-first sites</h2>
    	  <img src="../images/georgia.jpg" />
        <p>A responsive website is one that will automatically adjust itself to fit your device. It will resize text, headings, images and other elements, change the layout and any other changes that help the person (you) read the website.  It's important because of the huge range of devices used these days. Most people would use a mobile device ie. a phone, to browse websites and so any business or organisation wants to make sure the user has a good experience with their site.</p>
        <p>Mobile first design is where the layout is determined based on the dimensions of a mobile phone initially, and then changed to fit desktop browsers later on.  If you do desktop design first, its more likely to be a website that needs a bit of computer processing power and if opened on a phone, may be clunky and slow, or not work at all.  If the design is mobile-first, then its likely to work well on phones, and also desktops.</p>
        <p>Frameworks are like libraries. They have a bundle of code that you can borrow (forever), so that web developers don't need to keep reinventing the wheel.  Some pros are that it saves time and you can design a website that is industry standard and works well for most users and browsers. The cons are that they can be complicated, and take up more processing power to utilise than a simple website. You also have to stick to the framework semantics which you may not be used to.</p>
        <p>A wireframe is a sketch or outline of what the proposed website design will look like. It is usually just boxes or frames for where the content will go - no writing or pictures or colours yet.  It is used to get an idea of the balance on the screen mainly, and to see if elements fit on the page nicely.</p>

        <p>I found it difficult to get the header navs to go underneath the teacup logo when the screen size was smaller. It took a while to see the true width of those elements. It was also hard to get the elements to properly center on the page and I haven't figured that one out yet. I also need to work out how to get the nav links to turn into 3 lines under the logo when in mobile mode.</p>

        <h2>Meditation process</h2>
        <img src="../images/aaliya.jpg" />
        <p>The process over product actually confused me more, I feel. I read lots. Too much perhaps. I felt like I found tutorials that were just too informative and too complicated for what I wanted to achieve, but I didn't realise that till I had gotten half way through changing my code. In the end I came across a really simple skeleton based template and I finally understood it enough to adapt it to my needs. So, maybe the whole process did kinda work, and I learnt more about what I didn't want to do than figuring out what I did...hmm weird...Oh and I TOTALLY went too far down a multitude of rabbit holes. Like, so many damn holes...</p>
        <p>Before I read Meng's book I thought a lot about meditation. Often thought I should give it a go. Or more likely should make it a regular thing. I thought that it was a good thing to be able to do. But I have not yet been able to make it a habit and get good at it. Yet. Nothing much new in this chapter but it definitely reminded me that it's all about training the brain and flexing those meditating muscles.</p>

        <h2>Javascript basics</h2>
        <img src="../images/alice.jpg" />
        <p>How does Javascript compare to HTML and CSS? It's like chalk and cheese. It's like comparing preschool days to university courses. It's logic and maths compared to brick and mortar.  It made me use parts of my brain I did not know existed.</p>
       <p>Control flow and loops is the way in which JS sets out instructions or steps.  It is in order. For example, making a cup of tea. You could first turn on the jug. Then you have to keep checking if the jug is boiled (loop) until the right condition is met, which is hot water. At which point, and not before, you could then pour water into your mug.</p>
       <p>Data in arrays is accessed by calling the data's place in the list, ie. [0], [1], [2] etc. A piece of data in objects however, needs to be found with its unique name ie. {"Bob"}.</p>
       <p>Functions are a bunch of instructions put together in a tidy wee box and given a name. We can then use the name later on, and avoid having to type out the same instructions over and over. Its a time saver.</p>

         <h2>Daily Mindfulness</h2>
         <img src="../images/bubble.jpg" />
         <p>I thought I was a pretty good listener, but I realised just how little of my attention is actually on my partner when he is talking. Granted, he talks a lot. So giving him my full attention and a looping conversation was good for me. He also appreciated it as my feeding back on what I thought he had said, helped him feel like I was truly interested in the topic. Even though I wasn't. Useful technique...</p>
        <p>To sustain my mindfulness practice I will need to stick with small things first, and do less than I am capable of. Because I am still at the point where it is not a habit and I don't want to give up completely because something feels too onerous.</p>
        <p>We do looping conversation a lot in schools. When talking to students, or during difficult conversations with colleagues, the looping technique is very common. What improves that is the dipping, especially when you are discussing difficult issues or topics, and your emotions are all over the place.</p>

          <h2>Self Confidence</h2>
          <img src="../images/comic.jpg" />
          <p>The relationship between mindfulness and self awareness is a linear one. The better one becomes at mindfulness, the more aware you will be of your own emotions and the response your body has when feeling something. Then once you master self awareness you carry on along the linear journey towards self confidence.</p>
          <p>I remember years ago as a teenager doing a meditation exercise at school. The first part of it was doing Body Scanning, except we had to try and make each part we focused on, relax.  I did the body scanning again the other night. It was difficult to concentrate long on each part, and I didn't get down to my toes! I think I may have just passed out. So it was great for relaxing.  I felt like I didn't do it well, but also felt like I did better at the focus than in previous attempts.</p>
          <p>My Emotions Are Not Me; what a great reminder to not get too involved with your emotions especially when they are not good ones, and the bad ones often lead to arguments and tears from everyone. Sometimes I'm getting frustrated and angry with children leaving all of their belongings, in every part of the house except their own room. When I start telling them off its like I'm looking at my angry self from a distance, powerless to stop the trainwreck.  I think this self awareness will lead to power over those emotions and eventually I should be able to quiet the storm before it gets too big.</p>

           <h2>Problem solving</h2>
           <img src="../images/bridge.jpg" />
          <p>Oh, Hey non-tech friend! This one time, at EDA camp, I was trying to, like, get this programme to do this task. It was a simple task, all I really had to do was replicate the instructions from another programme. Easy. I typed it all out and pressed 'go'. Nothing. I spent a good half and hour comparing the code, line by line. Pressed go. Still nothing. I was getting some little messages popping up, but who knows what they meant, goddam thing should have been working. It was EXACTLY the same as the first code. I finally bit the bullet and read the instructions. It says getElementsByClassName. I had typed out getElementByClassName. Perhaps you can understand my frustration. Javascript reminds me a lot of golf...</p>
          <p>Now I'm supposed to tell you how I solved a problem in an elegant way....bahhhh ha ha haaaaaa...cough cough. If elegant means not swearing at the computer, then possibly I did that, once or twice. Googling, I feel, is not elegant. Because it sadly doesn't give you the exact correct answer you need. Actually, the best time I solved a problem was when I talked to the dog about it. I was trying to get a programme to do a fairly simple maths equation. I used to be good at maths, once, a long long long time ago. I couldn't figure out the order of the instructions and what things (variables) I was supposed to use.  So, I told the dog what I was trying to do. She barked, and the answer sort of formulated in my head. I learned that I should try a different approach quicker rather than bang my head against a brick wall. Or swear a lot. It was a roller coaster of emotion - intense concentration, then frustration, some despair, anger, then finally elation. It actually felt pretty good to solve the mystery without Google. Google is like a drug. Drugs are bad. Don't do drugs.</p>
          <p><b>Pseudocode</b> is really handy but very hard to spell. It made the activities much easier to complete, in fact without the guidance of pseudocode I doubt I would have been able to finish a lot of them. Great tool, definitely happy to use this.
          </p>
          <p><b>Trying Something</b> is what I do all day. I just jump in start typing. I've found it not terribly succesful though and probably wastes a lot of my time. Will not be doing as much of it.</p>
          <p><b>Rubber Ducky</b></p>As my dog knows, I am a fan. Its just so good to clarify your mind. Looking at a bunch of code on the screen and trying to see issues is hard. Much better to look away and talk it out. Or go to Slack and type it out with your friends. Who are more communicative and helpful than the dog.</p>
          <p><b>Reading error messages</b> is something I don't love doing, but am getting better at. A few weeks ago I was going cross-eyed trying to decipher Git error messages. Now they are not so scary, but still not my friend.</p>
          <p><b>Console.logging</b> is not at the top of my debugging list, but I know its there in case of emergency.</p>
          <p><b>Googling</b> is an easy thing to do, but not necessarily the best method. I have a bit of a habit, I know, but I am trying to not use it as such as crutch.</p>
          <p><b>Asking peers for help</b> alllll day, I love asking for help. I have such clever people in my cohort that I would be silly not to.</p>
          <p><b>Asking coaches for help</b> - they are pretty helpful. In a non-direct and guiding way. I feel like since the panic has subsided since the start of the course I don't leap to asking the tutors for help as much.</p>
          <p><b>Improving your process with reflection</b> is a work in process. I haven't had the energy to reflect too much. Too busy body scanning myself to try and get to sleep and get the javascript out of my head.</p>
