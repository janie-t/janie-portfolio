    	  <h2>About the EDA way...</h2>
        <p>I can see immediately this is a course that you get out what you put in. It is similar to the way I tried to teach in my classes. Instead of telling my students; this is the set of skills you will learn, I ask them, what do they want to make - now go and find the resources and learn the skills you need to get to that end goal. This is a more enjoyable and productive method to learn. It helps with motivation, and we can learn skills we are able to put into practice straight away.</p>
        <p>  First impressions are that this is a collaborative and supportive group; the communication channels are available on Slack, so we can get in touch with tutors or other students for help. Another impression is that the tools (such as Github) are a bit intimidating, but as we conquer them they should make life a lot easier.</p>
        <p>I feel like I have high expectations of myself to really engage with the content and do the best I can, and I am a huge fan of collaborative and supportive learning environments.  It definitely feels like a place I can learn at my own pace but be challenged too.</p>
        <p>At the moment I have nothing but good excited vibes, may it long last.  Ka mau te wehi!</p>

    	  <h2>Developing better time management and habits</h2>
        <p>We have been given a few time management tools and techniques to experiment with. I tried the 'hour timebox' while going over the learning resources.  The habit technique I tried was making a small change each morning. Now, I set the alarm 30 mins earlier and take the dog for a short walk. I am doing this every morning with the goal of eventually a) getting up earlier and earlier each day b) walk an hour each day. Am using the technique of making small changes, which are easy to repeat, with the long term affect that it turns into a habit which then changes other areas of my life.  I also tried meditating which is something I have been interested in and wanting to try, so I am going to aim to do that every morning for two minutes (to start with) and increase over time.</p>
        <p>I find it interesting to read about growth mindset outside of the educational setting. It is quite a popular thing at the moment in some schools, to help students develop a growth mindset and it is something I am quite familar with, in the context of secondary education. It really is something that can be useful in every day life and I think a great habit to develop for ourselves</p>
        <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique">'Pomodoro technique'</a> works well for me, because if I try and read or focus on a resource for too long I start to lose  concentration with the result that I skip over the task or resource and don't learn as deeply as I should. Working for a set amount of time really helped to keep the focus consistent.</p>
        <p>I am going to try longer meditation and also research more into the <a href="http://www.foggmethod.com/Fogg">'Fogg Method'</a> - how to give myself triggers to do the behaviours I want to see - this was an interesting comment from one of the resources that no behaviour happens without a trigger.</p>

    	  <h2>Mindfulness and Meditation</h2>
        <p>One of the main things I took from the <a href="https://siyli.org/">'Search Inside Yourself'</a> book is how we can change our mindset, the way we react to things and learn better. So often we think that our 'ways of doing' are set in stone and cannot be changed but this course shows that it is possible. Not only that, it is easy to do with some commitment. I enjoyed the humour in the writing and found it inspiring and very achievable.</p>

        <h2>Process Over Product</h2>
        <p>This was challenging for me. I get real motivation from seeing my product change in response to my styling the code, or adding images for example. So to put that aside and focus solely on how I am coding, rather than the outcome, was tough! In the end I came across a really simple skeleton based template and I saw that this was a useful tool for site responsiveness - and worth the initial time commitment to set it up.</p>

        <h2>Daily Mindfulness</h2>
        <p>In this topic we practiced Active Listening, using techniques like Looping. I thought I was a pretty good listener, but I realised just how little of my attention is actually on my partner when he is talking. Granted, he talks a lot. So giving him my full attention and a looping conversation was good for me. He also appreciated it as my feeding back on what I thought he had said, helped him feel like I was truly interested in the topic.</p>
        <p>We do looping conversation a lot in schools. When talking to students, or during difficult conversations with colleagues, the looping technique is very common. What improves that is the dipping (touching base with your own emotions or reactions to the conversation), especially when you are discussing difficult issues or topics.</p>

        <h2>Self Confidence</h2>
        <p>The relationship between mindfulness and self awareness is a linear one. The better one becomes at mindfulness, the more aware you will be of your own emotions and the response your body has when feeling something. Then once you master self awareness you carry on along the linear journey towards self confidence.</p>
        <p>My Emotions Are Not Me; what a great reminder to not get too involved with your emotions especially when they are not good ones. I am looking forward to working on this skill more, and being able to control and also avoid emotional upsets. Hopefully some of it will rub off on the 5 year old here too...</p>

        <h2>Control</h2>
        <p>When I am programming I have noticed a few triggers for emotional responses.  One is being interrupted when I am in 'the zone'. Another is when I am starting out on a task or activity and it sounds really complicated. My brain freezes. And lastly when I am blocked or stuck on something. Oh, and I get a really good happy response when the code works!</p>
        <p>A disproportionate emotional response comes from being interrupted when I'm in the zone, and maybe it's because I feel like it takes me a while to get there, and I really need to concentrate. Programming for me, is such an exercise of literal and mental sequence and order, that if I get interrupted I lose my place. It has been great to notice this, as I can proactively engage in some mindfulness to regain focus.  It's also good to consider these 'interruptions' as good opportunities to take a break.</p>

        <h2>Motivation</h2>
        <p>Some ways to find motivation are through pleasure, passion and purpose. Pleasure is a short lived, and difficult to find, motivator. Passion is found in tasks where we are in the 'zone' and have found the right balance between challenge and our own abilities. This happens more often than pleasure. Finally, purpose. When we are doing something altruistic or meaningful, we can sustain our motivation for very long periods of time.</p>
        <p>What are my motivators? The things that get me going...??</p>
        <p>My core values are: Whanau (family) care and protection. Respect, tolerance and acceptance for all people. Actively fighting against intolerance and injustice in society. Fighting for environmental protection and animal rights</p>
        <p>I stand for social equity and justice. I stand for feminism and the right for equality and equity in all areas of life, especially work environments.</p>

        <h2>Connecting</h2>
        <p>This topic looked at developing relationships through techniques for better trust, empathetic listening and political awareness. It basically describes the soft skills required as a teacher and what we do within a school organisation every day. It is important to be aware of things like the political relationships within an organisation - who are the real decision makers.  Look for people who can be allies. When wanting to make change - find like-minded allies to be on your 'waka' - drop the people who are rowing in the opposite direction!</p>
