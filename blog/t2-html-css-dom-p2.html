    <h3>BLOG POST - WHA</h3>

    <div id="main">
      <p>Grid based design is where the html layout is structured using rows and columns.  The common number of columns is 12 to allow for a range of layout designs. This is a flexible way of allowing different layouts while staying with the boxify concept.
      </p>

      <p>Responsive web design is a big deal these days because there are so many different kinds of devices being used.  From large screen desktops, to small mobile phones - the same website needs to be able to be usable and readable on every device in the world! So being responsive is kinda important!</p>

      <p>Semantic structure is when we start looking at the hierarchy of elements such as text on a page. Good practice is giving larger headings at the top of a page, an h1 tag, and this tells the browser that the heading is important and will be semantically placed at the top.  Then h2 under that, and h3 under that, etc.</p>

      <p>I hope that when I go back to my site now, and apply the grid design, it will make it a lot easier to adjust things like centering the navs.  Also, I would like to say that placepuppy.it just made my day!</p>
